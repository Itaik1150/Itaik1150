## About Me

I am a second-year Industrial Engineering and Management student at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. With a strong interest in coding, I enjoy solving problems and developing efficient solutions. I have experience in various programming languages, including Java, Python, Excel VBA, R, and SQL. I have completed projects such as simulating bus stations using multiple threads in Java and optimizing job placement on multiple machines using Excel VBA for my dissertation on production supervision planning. These experiences have enhanced my skills in programming, data analysis, and problem-solving.

## Skills

- Programming Languages: Java, Python, Excel VBA, R, SQL
- Tools and Technologies: Excel VBA, Git
- Other Skills: Problem-solving, Data Analysis, Project Management

## Projects

- **Bus Station Simulation (Java)**: Developed a multithreaded program in Java to simulate bus stations with different threads representing various stations. This project involved implementing concepts such as thread management, resource sharing, and inter-thread communication.

- **Optimal Job Placement (Excel VBA)**: Conducted a dissertation project on production supervision, where I used Excel VBA to find the optimal solution for placing jobs on multiple machines. This involved developing custom functionalities, input data management, algorithm design, and solution visualization.
